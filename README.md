# Meet2Teach

Meet2Teach is an idea, still growing and forming itself due to the Coronavirus situation.

A lot of my friends have kids, who have to stay at home and can't go to school - due to the Coronavirus situation.

Here in Germany - where I am from - this is a very unusual situation, as homeschooling is forbidden by law here. So, there are no regulations, no experience and many parents are totally overwhelmed. 

Plus, most parents are still have to work - regular or too in the home office.

Many of my friends with kids are freaking out.

With Meet2Teach I want to help and support kids and their parents facing these difficult times.
